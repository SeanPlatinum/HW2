problems with assignment: To be honest for the passed few days ive been stuck trying to come up with ways on how to position these 
elements where they should be, and for that I expect to lose some points as I definetly could not originally find a way to do this without
absolutely positioning the nav bar. I got very far using inline block and block elements however one thing caused me to just accept the 
fact that I couldn't get it to work propely otherwise: The Nav Bar. IT WOULD NOT TAKE UP THE ENTIRE BODY. I could give it a custom height 
however it wouldn't dynamically change with the window shrinking. So either it would only be a small box, or it would 
be statically sized and would look weird. Using absolute positioning saved me here...I had to make a choice,
either have the navbar ruin the site without absolute positioning or use abosulte and relative positioning. 
Also: had issues with alligning the marker gif icons with paragraph without messing up the wrapping from the image.
A big challenge: 
I think my biggest challenge is the fact you cant alter the html at all. Normally I would use flex box...I LOVE FLEX!!!
however i've been too accustomed to just making new div's when my flex box elements needing adjustments 

Overall: I really enjoyed this challenge, However I WOULD LOVE to have an explanation as to how you can do this without absolute positioning
